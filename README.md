# Entity Platform

**Entity** is a reasoning-first decision intelligence platform for teams.

It helps users go from **context → intent → structured reasoning → evidence → decisions**, with full transparency into *how* a conclusion was reached.

Unlike traditional dashboards or chat-only AI tools, Entity treats reasoning as a **first-class artifact**: inspectable, reproducible, and auditable.

## What Entity Does

At a high level, Entity lets you:

1. Create a **project**
2. Provide **context** (documents, data sources, assumptions)
3. Specify an **intent** (the decision or question you want to resolve)
4. Run structured **reasoning workflows**
5. Get a **decision output**, backed by:

   * Evidence
   * Data insights & charts
   * A traceable reasoning graph

Everything is observable and reviewable.

## Core Concepts

* **Workflow**: Graph-based reasoning and data operations (RPA + agents)
* **Reasoning**: Step-by-step hypothesis formation and evaluation
* **Evidence**: Explicit links to data, sources, and intermediate analysis
* **Artifacts**: Charts, tables, dashboards, and decision memos
* **Observability**: Full trace of what ran, why it ran, and what changed

## Product Philosophy

* Chat is the primary interface
* Reasoning should never be a black box
* Decisions should be explainable, not just plausible
* Systems should be reproducible and auditable by default

Entity is built for founders, operators, analysts, and teams making high-stakes decisions.

## Vision

Entity aims to become the canonical system for **decision intelligence** — where reasoning, data, and judgment converge in a single, transparent workflow.
